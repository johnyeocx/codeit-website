        review: "A student like me with little algorithm knowledge before attending the course, I ended up leaving with a great understanding of more complicated algorithms like queues, graphs and heaps. Mr. Ivan really managed to explain these topics with ease and simplicity, answering all questions without judgement. It was a pleasant experience that makes me want to join the next level!",

        review: "As someone with limited programming experience before the course, I felt that the course further reinforced my programming concepts and critical thinking ability. The trainers were not only interested in just teaching us the materials but made an effort to ensure that we were able to understand them by using simple analogies and real-life examples. I enjoyed each session as they were always engaging and interactive. There is always something new to take away from every lesson :)",
